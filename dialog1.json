    "Person A: Hey, I've been working on this project for a while now, but I'm not making much progress.",
    "Person B: Well, have you clearly defined the problem you're trying to solve?",
    "Person A: I think so, but I'm not entirely sure.",
    "Person B: It's crucial to have a good problem definition. Without it, you can waste a lot of time and energy solving the wrong problem.",
    "Person A: That's true. How do you usually approach defining a problem?",
    "Person B: I start by analyzing the situation and identifying what's not working or what needs improvement. Then, I prefer to write down the problem definition.",
    "Person A: Writing it down? Why is that important?",
    "Person B: When you write it down, you're forced to articulate the problem precisely. It helps you clarify your thoughts and prevents any ambiguity.",
    "Person A: I see. So, without a well-written problem definition, you can waste your efforts solving the wrong problem.",
    "Person B: Exactly. Writing it down also serves as a reference point to keep you on track and focused on the right goal."
